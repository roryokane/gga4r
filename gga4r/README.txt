==Introduction

General Genetic Algorithm for Ruby is a Ruby Genetic Algorithm that is very simple to use:

	1) Take a class to evolve it and define fitness, recombine and mutate methods.
			class StringPopulation < Array
			    def fitness
			      self.select { |pos| pos == 1 }.size.to_f / self.size.to_f
			    end
			
			    def recombine(c2)
			      cross_point = (rand * c2.size).to_i
			      c1_a, c1_b = self.separate(cross_point)
			      c2_a, c2_b = c2.separate(cross_point)
			      [StringPopulation.new(c1_a + c2_b), StringPopulation.new(c2_a + c1_b)]
			    end
			
			    def mutate
			      mutate_point = (rand * self.size).to_i
			      self[mutate_point] = 1
			    end
			end
	
	2) Create a GeneticAlgorithm object with the population.
			def create_population_with_fit_all_1s(s_long = 10, num = 10)
			    population = []
			    num.times  do
			      chromosome = StringPopulation.new(Array.new(s_long).collect { (rand > 0.2) ? 0:1 })
			      population << chromosome
			    end
			    population
			end
		
			ga = GeneticAlgorithm.new(create_population_with_fit_all_1s)
	
	3) Call the evolve method as many times as you want and see the best evolution.
			100.times { |i|  ga.evolve }
			p ga.best_fit[0]

==Install

1) Execute:
	gem install gga4r

2) Add require in your code headers:
	require "rubygems"
	require "gga4r"


==Attention

 Please note that Gga4r adds shuffle!, each_pair and separate methods to the Array class.

==Documentation

Documentation can be generated using rdoc tool under the source code with:
